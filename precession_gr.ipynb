    "We are going to derive the effect of GR on Mercury's orbit by modelling the Sun-Mercury system in Schwarzschild geometry.  The Sun's mass will define the geometry of spacetime outside it, and Mercury will be the test particle simply following force-free geodesic motion in that geometry.\n",
    "This treatment is reasonable because:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "<li>Mass of Sun is about $10^7$ times mass of Mercury, so Mercury can effectively be treated like a test particle w.r.t. a stationary Sun</li>\n",
    "<li>Schwarzschild Radius ($R_s = 2GM / c^2$) of the Sun is about 3000 mt while its radius is $7 * 10^8$ mt, so Schwarzschild radius lies well inside the physical boundary of the Sun, and we assume Schwarzschild geometry outside the Sun</li>\n",
    "<li>Average orbital radius of Mercury $<R>$ is $57 * 10^9$ mt, so $R_s / <R>$ is approximately $5 * 10^{-7}$, and so, while the GR effect will be small, for Mercury it can still be measured over a few thousand revolutions due to its cumulative effect</li>\n",
